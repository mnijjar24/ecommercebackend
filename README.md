# Ecommerce-Backend

## Welcome to the ecommerce-backend application

Ecommerce-backend is a backend application for an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies! It has many features, such as when a database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password is entered, a connection to a database is presented using Sequelize. Furthermore, as schema and seed commands are entered, then is development database is created and seeded with test data. Also, when the API GET routes are opened in Insomnia for categories, products and/or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. Lastly, when testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they are successfully able to create, update, and delete data in the database!
